                        SubStop is a subscription payment management service used to monitor recurring payments via credit cards bills and Internet
                        browsing history. The UI is a chrome extension, which allows the user to login to the service and update their user information.
                        The back-end is a RESTful API service, meant to connect the chrome extension to Captial Oneâ€™s Nessie API, and process browsing
                        information. The API then detects any unused subscriptions (based on browsing) and will alert the user accordingly.
